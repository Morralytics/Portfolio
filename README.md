## Description

This application was created to display my the projects I have completted as well as share a little bit about myself as I enter the job market as a Full Stack Engineer. My portfolio page shows not only projects I am proud of but a bit of insight on myself and the branding I have chosen. This is an ever evolving portfolio however, I am exited to show everyone what I am capable of.
